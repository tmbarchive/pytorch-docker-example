dpytorch
========

A command line that runs PyTorch almost as if it was natively installed.
This is probably what you want for Linux. Run Jupyter with:

    $ dpython jupyter lab

run-myjupyter
=============

A more "pedestrian" Docker configuration that can be customized for specific
environments; this is useful on OSX and Windows.

  - run-myjupyter -- startup script
  - myjupyter.dock -- Dockerfile that sets up a UNIXy environment
